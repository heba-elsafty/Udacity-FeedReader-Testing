# Udacity FEND - FeedReader Testing

This is the Udacity Front-End Nanodegree - FeedReader Testing Project.

## Details

In this project, I learned about testing with Javascript. Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard known as "test-driven development" or TDD. This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application.

## Getting Started

The Jasmine tests can be found in `/jasmine/spec/feedreader.js`.

### Prerequisites

```
node.js
yarn
```

### Installing

Firstly. Clone the project to your computer.
```sh
git clone git@github.com:Asjas/Udacity-FeedReader-Testing.git
cd Udacity-FeedReader-Testing
```

Then install the npm packages by using yarn.

```sh
yarn install
```

Finally run the website.

```sh
yarn run watch
```

This will then start a local dev server on `localhost:3000`.
